Print-radicals is a project I created as part of my Javascript education with DevMtn. It is the frist fullstack app in my career in Javascript. The concept was to create a plaform to connect owners of 3D printers who want to get more use out of them with users who have designs they want printed but don't otherwise have access to 3D printing, and to facilitate payment across the platform. As of this writing (May 20, 2019) it has only the barest set out of the features I wanted to give it. After completeing DevMtn I'll continue to work on it for the sake of my own continued education, though I have no intention of creating a full-scale production ready build.
